🛠️ Project Stack & Dependencies
The project is built using a modern Rust ecosystem focused on type safety and performance.

Core Frameworks
Leptos (v0.7): A full-stack, isomorphic Rust web framework.

Actix-Web: The server-side runner (SSR) used to handle HTTP requests and Server Functions.

SurrealDB: A multi-model graph database used for data persistence.

Key Libraries
surrealdb: The official driver for database interactions.

charts_rs: Used for generating SVG-based charts (like the Staff Distribution bar chart).

serde / serde_json: Handles serialization and deserialization of data structures.

tailwind-css: Integrated via leptos_meta for styling using utility classes.

uuid: For generating unique identifiers for person records.

num_format: Used for formatting currency and large numbers on the dashboard.

1. src/main.rs
The heart of the Server-Side Rendering (SSR). It initializes the Actix server, sets up Leptos routes, and listens for incoming connections on port 3000.

2. src/app/models/person.rs
Defines the Person struct. This model is shared between the frontend and backend, ensuring that data is valid on both sides of the network.

3. src/app/db/database.rs
Contains the "Raw" database logic. It uses a static connection pool to SurrealDB. This is where SELECT, CREATE, and DELETE queries are executed.

4. src/app/server_functions/
Contains code annotated with #[server]. These functions act as an automated API. When the frontend calls add_person(), Leptos automatically handles the POST request to the server, which then talks to the database.

🎨 Visual Identity (Radon Theme)
The project uses a custom color palette defined by the user (Radon Theme). Instead of standard Tailwind colors, the app utilizes these specific hex codes via arbitrary values:

Dark Maroon (bg-[#38000A]): Main background and containers.

Bright Red (bg-[#CD1C18]): Primary buttons, widgets, and accents.

Deep Red (bg-[#9B1313]): Hover states and secondary bars in charts.

Peach/Salmon (text-[#FFA896]): Highlight text, labels, and borders.

🚀 How the System Works
Hydration: When a user visits the site, the server sends a pre-rendered HTML page. The browser then "hydrates" it with WASM, making the buttons interactive.

State Management: Leptos signals are used to keep the UI in sync. When a new person is added, the Resource for the list of people is refreshed.

Database Flow: * Frontend: User clicks "Submit" in AddPersonModal.

Server Function: The frontend calls the server function in persons.rs.

Backend: The server function calls database.rs which performs the SurrealDB query.

Result: The UI updates automatically based on the returned data.

🛠️ Common Maintenance Commands
Clean Build: cargo clean (Useful for fixing compiler cache errors).

Run Development: cargo leptos watch (Hot-reloads the app on save).

SurrealDB Start: surreal start --user Radon --pass [PASSWORD] memory (Starts a temporary in-memory database).
